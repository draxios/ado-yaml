Azure DevOps uses service connections to securely connect to external services like AWS.

Here's why a service connection is important:

Authentication and Authorization: The service connection handles the authentication and authorization between Azure DevOps and AWS. It uses credentials, such as access keys or IAM roles, to securely connect and perform actions on your behalf.

Encapsulation of Credentials: Service connections encapsulate the credentials, so you don’t have to hard code them in your pipeline scripts. This is a best practice for security.

Ease of Use: Once set up, a service connection can be easily referenced in your YAML pipelines, making it straightforward to integrate with AWS services.

Centralized Management: Service connections are managed centrally in Azure DevOps, allowing for better control and management of external service credentials.

For your scenarios, you would typically create an AWS service connection in Azure DevOps, providing the necessary credentials and permissions to interact with ECR, ECS, and Lambda. This connection will then be referenced in your YAML pipeline as shown in the previous examples (e.g., awsCredentials: 'YourAWSServiceConnectionName').

To set up a service connection in Azure DevOps:

Go to your project in Azure DevOps.
Navigate to "Project settings" at the bottom left.
Under "Pipelines", select "Service connections".
Choose "New service connection" and select AWS.
Fill in the required details like Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, and give the service connection a name.
After this setup, your YAML pipelines will be able to use this service connection to perform operations in AWS.


--What do I need to do on the AWS side to get my details for the service connection? I dont think we use IAM users, we use roles. So we have agents in AWS that assume roles that have permissions.

If you are using IAM roles in AWS and your build agents in AWS assume these roles to gain permissions, you'll need to set up a service connection in Azure DevOps that aligns with this approach. Since you don't use IAM users, the process involves a few extra steps to ensure secure and seamless integration between Azure DevOps and AWS. Here's what you need to do:

1. Create an IAM Role for Azure DevOps
You need to create an IAM role in AWS that Azure DevOps can assume to perform actions. This role should have the necessary permissions to access ECR, ECS, Lambda, or any other AWS services your pipelines interact with.

Steps to Create an IAM Role:
Go to the IAM Management Console in AWS.
Create a New Role:
Choose a role type that allows external identities to assume this role. You can use the "Another AWS account" option because Azure DevOps, even though not an AWS account, will assume this role.
For Account ID, you can use your AWS account ID.
Important: Enable "Require external ID" and provide a unique external ID. This external ID is used by Azure DevOps to assume this role, adding an extra layer of security.
Attach Policies: Attach policies that grant permissions needed for your CI/CD operations.
Review and Create: Name your role and create it.
2. Setting Up Azure DevOps Service Connection
With the IAM role created, you can now set up the service connection in Azure DevOps.

Steps for Azure DevOps:
Go to Project Settings in your Azure DevOps project.
Navigate to Service Connections under Pipelines.
Choose "New service connection" and select the AWS service connection type.
In the configuration:
Instead of providing Access Key ID and Secret Access Key, you will provide the Role ARN of the IAM role you created.
Provide the External ID you used when creating the IAM role. This is crucial for the "Assume Role" functionality.
3. Configuring Your Pipelines
In your YAML pipelines, when setting up tasks that interact with AWS, reference this service connection. The tasks in Azure DevOps will use this connection to assume the IAM role you set up in AWS and perform the required actions.

Security Considerations
The external ID is a security feature to prevent the "confused deputy" problem, ensuring that only Azure DevOps can assume this role.
Ensure that the IAM role's permissions are tightly scoped to only what's necessary for your CI/CD processes.
By following these steps, you create a secure link between Azure DevOps and AWS that aligns with your current practice of using roles instead of users. This approach maintains the security and efficiency of your CI/CD pipelines.

---How can I get the external ID for the role in AWS console?

The external ID for an IAM role in AWS is not something you can retrieve from the AWS console because it's not generated by AWS. Instead, it's a value that you provide when you set up the trust relationship for the role. This external ID acts as a shared secret between your AWS account and the third-party service (in this case, Azure DevOps) that is allowed to assume the role.

Here's how you can handle the external ID:

If You're Creating a New Role
Go to the IAM Management Console in AWS.
Create a New Role: Choose a role type that allows external identities (like Azure DevOps) to assume this role.
Establish Trust Relationship:
When setting up the trust relationship, you'll specify Azure DevOps as a principal.
In the trust policy, you include a condition to require an external ID. This is where you specify the external ID.
The external ID should be a unique, hard-to-guess string. You can generate this yourself.
Here's an example of what the trust policy might look like:

json
Copy code
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::<Azure_DevOps_Account_ID>:root"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "sts:ExternalId": "YourUniqueExternalID"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
In this policy, replace YourUniqueExternalID with the external ID you've created.

If the Role Already Exists
If the IAM role already exists and you want to add or change the external ID, you can edit the trust relationship:

Go to the IAM Management Console in AWS.
Find the Role: Navigate to the role you’re using for Azure DevOps.
Edit the Trust Relationship: There’s an option to edit the trust relationship of the role. Here, you can add the condition for the external ID as shown in the example above.
Remember, the external ID is not visible or retrievable like other AWS configuration details. You should store it securely, as it's used to prevent unauthorized entities from assuming your IAM role. When you configure your service connection in Azure DevOps, you'll need to provide this external ID.

--What if we already have a role that has all these permissions that was setup long ago. Thing is, we dont currently use Service Connections. So when I'm adding it, im worried I wont be able to provide an external id

If you're adding a service connection in Azure DevOps and you already have an IAM role in AWS that was set up without an external ID, you have a couple of options:

1. Modify the Existing IAM Role to Include an External ID
If the existing IAM role does not have an external ID, you can modify its trust relationship to include one. This is a common approach when transitioning to a setup that uses service connections. Here's how you can do it:

Log in to the AWS Management Console and go to the IAM (Identity and Access Management) dashboard.
Navigate to Roles and find the existing IAM role used for Azure DevOps.
Edit the Trust Relationship: There should be an option to edit the trust relationship of the role. You can then add a condition to require an external ID.
The trust policy might look like this after modification:

json
Copy code
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": "codepipeline.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "sts:ExternalId": "YourChosenExternalID"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
Replace YourChosenExternalID with a unique ID that you create.

2. Create a New IAM Role with an External ID
If modifying the existing role is not feasible or if you prefer to keep it unchanged, you can create a new IAM role specifically for use with Azure DevOps. This role would have the external ID setup from the beginning:

Create a New Role in AWS with the necessary permissions.
Include the External ID in the trust relationship during the creation process.
3. Use IAM Role Without External ID (Not Recommended)
Technically, you can set up a service connection in Azure DevOps without an external ID by just specifying the IAM role ARN. However, this approach is less secure because the external ID provides an additional layer of security to ensure that only Azure DevOps can assume this role.

After Setting Up in AWS
Once you have your IAM role configured with an external ID:

In Azure DevOps, create a new service connection for AWS.
Select the option to use IAM Role for cross-account access.
Provide the Role ARN and the External ID you set up in AWS.
This will allow Azure DevOps to securely assume the IAM role and perform actions in AWS as per the role's permissions.

--What if my role is name "az-host-master" but how can I get the arn for it?

To find the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of your IAM role named "az-host-master" in AWS, you can follow these steps:

Log into the AWS Management Console: Use your AWS account credentials to log in.

Navigate to the IAM Dashboard: Once logged in, go to the Services menu and select "IAM" to open the Identity and Access Management dashboard.

Roles Section: In the IAM dashboard, click on "Roles" on the left-hand side navigation menu. This will display a list of all the IAM roles in your account.

Search for Your Role: Use the search bar to find the role named "az-host-master". You can simply type the name into the search box to filter the list.

View Role Details: Click on the role name "az-host-master" to view its details.

Find the Role ARN: In the role summary section, you will see the ARN for the role. It typically follows this format:

ruby
Copy code
arn:aws:iam::<Your-AWS-Account-Number>:role/az-host-master
Copy this ARN, as you will need it to set up your service connection in Azure DevOps.

Remember, the ARN is a unique identifier for the role in AWS and it includes your AWS account number. Ensure that you keep this information secure, especially when configuring your service connections in Azure DevOps.
